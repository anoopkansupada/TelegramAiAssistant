# Telegram CRM User Experience Guide

## **Overview**
This document outlines the user journey for onboarding and managing Telegram chats in the CRM system, including AI-driven company suggestions and follow-up workflows.

---

## **1️⃣ User Onboarding**
### **Step 1: Confirm Telegram Phone Number**
- User lands on the login screen.
- Enters their Telegram phone number.
- Receives a confirmation code via Telegram.
- If **2FA is enabled**, the user must enter their password (currently not fully functional).
- Upon successful verification, a session key is generated for authentication.

💡 **Tech Details:**
- Use **Telethon** or **Telegram API login flow**.
- Optionally integrate with **OAuth for future authentication**.
- Session key will be used for persistent login.

### **Step 2: Create Password (if applicable)**
- If the user has 2FA, they must enter their password.
- If returning user, logs in with phone + session key.
- Upon successful authentication, redirected to the Chats page.

💡 **Tech Details:**
- Store encrypted passwords (bcrypt) if applicable.
- Offer **"Forgot Password?"** option in case 2FA is re-enabled later.

## **2️⃣ Chats Management**
### **Step 3: Chats Dashboard**
- User lands on the **Chats** page.
- Displays a list of Telegram conversations.
- **User selects which chats to sync** (rather than syncing everything automatically).
- Features available:
  - **Full search and sorting** (by date, company, priority, participants, unread messages, etc.).
  - **Unread message count & last activity timestamp.**
  - **AI-driven categorization**: The system automatically categorizes chats based on past interactions and business importance.
  - Each chat has two options:
    1. ✅ **Add to CRM** → Moves chat into CRM workflow.
    2. ❌ **Ignore Chat** → Moves chat to an **Ignored Chats List** (can be restored if needed).

💡 **Tech Details:**
- Fetch **user-selected Telegram conversations**.
- Store rejected chats in a **“Ignored Chats” list**.

## **3️⃣ AI-Powered CRM Integration**
### **Step 4: AI Company & Contact Confirmation**
- If a chat is added to CRM, AI suggests a company **with a confidence score**.
- AI gathers data from:
  - 🔗 **LinkedIn** (Company profile & employees).
  - 🐦 **Twitter** (Recent tweets & sentiment analysis).
  - 🌍 **Company Website** (Extract metadata).
  - 📜 **Docs** (PDFs, GitHub, shared links in chat).
  - 🎥 **YouTube, social media, industry news.**
  - 👤 **Social accounts of key leaders (Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.).**
- **AI-driven default confirmation**: The AI suggests the best match, and users override only if necessary, reducing manual work.
- **User manually confirms:**
  1. The correct **Company (Name, URL, Socials, etc.)** before finalizing.
  2. The correct **Contacts (Usernames, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)** before moving them into CRM.

💡 **Tech Details:**
- AI models scan **chat names, messages, & shared links**.
- API calls to **LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, YouTube, and Crunchbase** for enrichment.
- Store **all user confirmations for AI learning and future recommendations**.

## **4️⃣ CRM & Follow-Up Workflow**
### **Step 5: Final CRM Integration**
- Once a company is confirmed:
  - Chat is **officially added to CRM**.
  - Contact list is **extracted & linked** to the company.
  - AI suggests **next steps (follow-ups, meeting reminders).**
  - User can **view company profile in CRM.**
- **AI-generated follow-ups**: Instead of passive reminders, AI schedules auto-sent Telegram messages for follow-ups at the best engagement time.

💡 **Tech Details:**
- Store **structured data in PostgreSQL**.
- Enable **AI-driven automatic Telegram follow-up scheduling**.
- System evolves by learning user preferences over time.

## **5️⃣ Deeper Business Intelligence**

- **Multi-user support:** Expand CRM collaboration features.
- **Real-time notifications:** AI insights delivered directly to the user.
- **Crypto-Specific Trend Monitoring**: AI continuously scans **industry trends, social media, and thought leaders** to surface key insights for business development.
