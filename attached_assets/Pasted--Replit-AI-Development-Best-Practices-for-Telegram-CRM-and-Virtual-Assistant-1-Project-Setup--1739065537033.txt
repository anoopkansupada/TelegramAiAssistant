# Replit AI Development Best Practices for Telegram CRM and Virtual Assistant

## 1. Project Setup
### 1.1 Repository and Version Control
- **Always use Git**: Store code in a GitHub repository for version control.
- **Use `.gitignore`**: Prevent unnecessary files from being committed (e.g., `.venv`, `.replit`, `__pycache__/`).
- **Enable Replit Git integration**: Link your Replit project to GitHub for smooth commits and updates.

### 1.2 Environment Configuration
- **Use a `.replit` file**:
  ```ini
  run = "python3 main.py"
  language = "python3"
  entrypoint = "main.py"
  ```
- **Create a `requirements.txt`**:
  - List all dependencies explicitly, including:
    - `python-telegram-bot` (for Telegram bot capabilities)
    - `Telethon` or `Pyrogram` (for Telegram user bot capabilities)
    - `tldv.io API client` (for meeting transcript integration via Zapier)
    - `PostgreSQL` or `MongoDB` client (for CRM storage)
    - `NLTK` or `spaCy` (for NLP processing)
  - Install using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
  - Set up using: `python3 -m venv venv`
  - Activate: `source venv/bin/activate`

## 2. Bot Structure & Responsibilities
### 2.1 Telegram Bot (Bot API)
- **Only executes actions when prompted via the web UI.**
- **Broadcast announcements** to specific chats when requested.
- **No automated actions within Telegram chats.**

### 2.2 User Bot (Telethon/Pyrogram)
- **Reads all historical and ongoing conversations.**
- **Analyzes meeting transcripts from TLDV.io via Zapier integration.**
- **Suggests follow-ups and next steps based on meeting discussions.**
- **Creates reminders for due projects.**
- **Only sends messages on behalf of the user when approved in the web UI.**

### 2.3 AI Knowledge Hub & CRM
- **Knowledge Hub per Company:**
  - Aggregates and structures all available data (Telegram conversations, meeting transcripts, external company updates).
  - Suggests how to engage with companies based on new documents, tweets, or announcements.
- **Matching AI:**
  - When added to a new chat, suggests what company it thinks is involved (via LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.).
  - Suggests possible identities of chat members based on available public data.
  - Allows the user to manually associate contacts with their team and company.
- **CRM Task Management System:**
  - Creates follow-ups and reminders based on conversations and meetings.
  - Links every contact to a company.
  - AI proactively suggests engagement strategies.

## 3. Code Execution Best Practices
### 3.1 Managing Compute Resources
- **Avoid infinite loops**: Implement structured message polling and API request handling.
- **Use environment variables**: Store API keys securely using Replit’s `Secrets` manager.
- **Run background tasks asynchronously**: Use `asyncio` to prevent blocking operations.

### 3.2 Debugging and Logging
- **Use structured logging**: `logging` over `print` statements for traceability.
- **Enable debugging mode**:
  ```python
  import logging
  logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
  ```

## 4. AI-Driven Insights & CRM Integration
- **No sentiment analysis; AI functions as an SDR.**
- **Weekly digest of insights sent to email.**
- **Real-time updates on new interactions, meeting notes, and opportunities.**
- **Automatically links external company information to CRM.**

## 5. Security, Privacy & Hosting Plan
- **Full message storage (historical and real-time).**
- **Only the user has access; no external sharing.**
- **Initial development on Replit, transitioning to real hosting after full build-out.**

## 6. Scalability & Future Development
- **Designed to handle 1,000 messages per day (for a single user).**
- **Long-term goal: expand to multiple users and team collaboration features.**
- **Future AI developments: Proactive information recommendations based on company actions (tweets, announcements, etc.).**
