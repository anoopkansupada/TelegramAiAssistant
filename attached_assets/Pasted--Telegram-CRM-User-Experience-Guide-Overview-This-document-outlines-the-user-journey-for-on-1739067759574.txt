## **1️⃣ User Onboarding**

- Upon successful verification, a session key is generated for authentication.

💡 **Tech Details:**

- Optionally integrate with **OAuth for future authentication**.
- Session key will be used for persistent login.

### **Step 2: Create Password (if applicable)**

## **2️⃣ Chats Management**
### **Step 3: Chats Dashboard**

  2. The correct **Contacts (Usernames, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)** before moving them into CRM.

💡 **Tech Details:**
- AI models scan **chat names, messages, & shared links**.
