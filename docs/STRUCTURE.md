## Documentation Standards
Each document should follow this structure:

2. Core Concepts
3. Implementation Details
4. Examples
5. Troubleshooting
6. Version History

## Cross-referencing
- Use relative links for cross-document references
- Maintain a consistent navigation structure
- Include "Related Topics" sections
- Link to relevant code examples

## Version Control
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Document breaking changes prominently
- Include migration guides between versions
- Maintain a changelog for each major component
